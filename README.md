# Exchange Rates Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing exchange rate data using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes data preparation and an in-depth look at three example investments. The project starts with a single Excel file containing exchange rates (waluty.xlsx) and culminates in five distinct Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the data analysis.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following Jupyter Notebooks:

    1_Data_preparation.ipynb  
    2_Analysis_of_average_monthly_exchange_rates.ipynb  
    3_Investment_analysis.ipynb  
    4_Minimum_and_maximum_investment_analysis.ipynb  
    5_Most_profitable_investments_in_a_given_month.ipynb
